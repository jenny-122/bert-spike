# Project Overview

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of an uncased BERT model adapted for the classification of spike protein sequences. By treating amino acid sequences as "text," we're able to apply powerful language model architectures to predict important biological properties and classifications.

# Key Features

Uncased BERT model fine-tuned for biological sequence classification
Custom dataset handling for protein/genomic sequence data
Comprehensive evaluation metrics (accuracy, BLEU, ROUGE)
Visualization tools for model performance analysis
